    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <dl>
        <strong>To prepare parautha dough:</strong>
        <dt>Step 1</dt>
        <dd>Mix the atta and salt well together. Add a few drops of oil and mix with fingertips.</dd>
        <dt>Step 2</dt>
        <dd>Add water little at a time and keep kneading into a soft dough.</dd>
        <dt>Step 3</dt>
        <dd>Knead for 3-4 mins and coat with some more oil (don't overdo the oil bit, very few drops will do). Set aside while making the filling.</dd>
        <strong>To prepare aalu parautha filling:</strong>
        <dt>Step 4</dt>
        <dd>Boil and grate the potatoes. I used to mash them but that leaves small lumps here and there making it harder to roll out the aloo parathas smoothly. Grating is a better method to ensure a smooth filling.</dd>
        <dt>Step 5</dt>
        <dd>Mix all ingredients for the filling together, making sure they are well incorporated.</dd>
        <dt>Step 6</dt>
        <dd>The spices you add to the filling also make a large difference to the taste of your aloo parathas. There are tons of different versions here.</dd>
        <dt>Step 7</dt>
        <dd>Divide the dough into 8 equal parts and roll into smooth balls. Do the same with the filling. I like to make the size of the filling slightly smaller than the dough balls but you can make them into equal sizes if you wish.</dd>
        <dt>Step 8</dt>
        <dd>Flour the surface you are going to use to roll the parathas.</dd>
        <dt>Step 9</dt>
        <dd>Take one dough ball, place it on the floured surface and flatten with fingertips into a small round. I find that doing this with my fingertips makes it easier to get the surface equally thick than rolling with a rolling pin.</dd>
        <dt>Step 10</dt>
        <dd>Place a ball of potato filling in the centre of the flattened dough ball.</dd>
        <dt>Step 11</dt>
        <dd>Gather the dough ball around the filling, sealing it gently on top.</dd>
        <dt>Step 12</dt>
        <dd>Make it into a momo-like ball, making sure that the dough covers the filling ball completely.</dd>
        <dt>Step 13</dt>
        <dd>You can pinch off the extra bit of dough on top. I sometimes just flatten it against the top and continue.</dd>
        <dt>Step 14</dt>
        <dd>Again, using your fingertips, gently press the filled dough ball into a small circle, making sure the thickness is equal on all sides.</dd>
        <dt>Step 15</dt>
        <dd>Then use your rolling pin to flatten it out to as thick or thin as you want. I keep it slightly thicker than chapatis.</dd>
        <dt>Step 16</dt>
        <dd>Transfer rolled paratha to a hot griddle. Make sure you tap out the excess flour used in rolling.</dd>
        <dt>Step 17</dt>
        <dd>Cook until both sides are golden brown.</dd>
        <dt>Step 18</dt>
        <dd>Cook until both sides are golden brown.</dd>
        <dt>Step 19</dt>
        <dd>When done, brush with some ghee / butter or oil and transfer to a plate.</dd>
